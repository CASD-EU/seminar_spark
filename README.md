# seminar_spark

In this repo, we show some sample code to illustrate the concept which we present in the seminar spark.

## Sample notebooks

In folder [notebooks](./notebooks), you can find three notebooks.
- [01.spark_intro.ipynb](./notebooks/01.spark_intro.ipynb): shows a classic data analysis which counts word frequency in a book
- [02.spark_ml.ipynb](./notebooks/02.spark_ml.ipynb): shows how to use spark to train a logistic regression model.
- [03.spark_graphX.ipynb](./notebooks/03.spark_graphX.ipynb): shows how to use spark to build and analysis graph.

## Api example

In folder [api_examples](./api_examples), we show a simple code which counts word frequency in a book with the below api
- [scala api](./api_examples/SimpleApp.scala)
- [python api](./api_examples/SimpleApp.py)
- [R api(sparklyr)](./api_examples/SimpleApp_sparklyr.R)
- [R api(sparkR)](./api_examples/SimpleApp_sparkR.R)
